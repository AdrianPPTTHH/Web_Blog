## C++high concurrency programming



### 1. Concurrency, processes, threads





##### Basic knowledge



1. There is only one main thread in a process.



2. All threads in a process share an address space (shared memory).



3. In process communication: pipes, files, message queues, shared memory



Thread communication: Global variables, pointers, and references can all be passed between threads (difficulty: issue of shared memory data consistency)



(Priority should be given because it is lightweight, has low system overhead, faster execution speed, and memory sharing, which is faster than using any other communication method.)



4. After C++11, the addition of C++'s own multithreading means that cross platform portability has been improved.



5. In general, after the main thread finishes running, the child threads will be forcibly terminated by the operating system.





##### Multithreading



# Include<thread>



Thread mytobj (the executed function,);



Mytobj. coin()//The main thread waits for the child thread to end
